* HTML strcuture is readable and easy to mantain an reuse
* I've created Custom Proprties to manage raw values
* Also got to add one more color to keep consistence with the mockup
* An icon CDN library was added for twitter and linkedin icons. (missing in the AC). The rest are the SVG provided in the Story
* CSS reset applied
* Colors and fonts were taken from AC
* CSS is organized by sections to keep order
* Grid and Flex were implemented in order to fulfill AC and keep code mantainable in a simple way

* With some more time I can deliver it 'at pixel' (taking into account I'm curently working for a full-time position)
* Also can add logic and form validation in case needed
